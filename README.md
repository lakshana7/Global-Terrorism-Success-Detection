<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Considering the intensifying threat of terrorist attacks, the indispensable requirement for 
analysing, understanding and interpreting the multi-dimensional obstacles inflicted by the terrorist 
activities.  This problem statement aims to interpret key trends and analytics of the attacksâ€™ 
aftermaths and then conclude on important observations which are based on few data-driven 
insights that help in mitigating the impact of these terrorist attacks and prevent future incidents at 
global scale. The ultimate goal is understand the repeated hidden trends that have taken place in 
the past over the years 1970 to 2017 and then make some advanced predictions with observed 
observations.</p>

<h2>Phase 1 Analysis of Data</h2>
<h3>Preprocessing</h3>
<p>The process of locating and fixing or removing errors and inconsistencies from datasets is 
known as data cleaning, sometimes known as data cleansing or data preparation. It entails getting 
the data ready for analysis by making sure it is correct, comprehensive, and formatted correctly. 
Data cleaning encompasses a variety of tasks, including:</p>


<ul>
    <li>Data Investigation</li>
    <li>Features Selection</li>
    <li>Handling Missing Data</li>
    <li>Handling Duplicate Values</li>
    <li>Handling Null Values</li>
    <li>Handling Non-Positive Values</li>
    <li>Column Integration</li>
    <li>Handling Inconsistent Data</li>
    <li>Renaming Columns</li>
    <li>Sorting Columns and Reset Index</li>
</ul>
